// What is a first class function

// In Javascript, functions are first class objects. 
// First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

// For example, in such a language, 
// a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, 
// can be returned by another function 
//  can be assigned as a value to a variable. 

// For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener

const handler = () => console.log("This is a click handler function");
document.addEventListener("click", handler);
