// What is tree shaking

/*

Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for 
that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). 
Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler rollup.
