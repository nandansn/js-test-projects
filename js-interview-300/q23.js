// How do you decode or encode a URL in JavaScript?

/*

URL encoding and decoding is the process of converting special characters and reserved characters in a URL into a format that can be transmitted over the internet. 
There are various use cases for URL encoding and decoding, some of which are:

1. Sending data via HTTP GET or POST requests: When sending data via HTTP GET or POST requests, 
the data needs to be encoded to ensure that any special characters in the data do not interfere with the URL or the request itself.

2. Creating links: When creating links that contain special characters, URL encoding is used to ensure that the link is properly formatted and can be clicked on without any errors.

3. Storing data in cookies: Cookies are used to store small amounts of data on a user's computer. When storing data in cookies, the data needs to be URL encoded to ensure that it can be properly stored and retrieved.

4. Parsing data from URLs: When parsing data from a URL, URL decoding is used to convert the encoded characters back into their original form.

In JavaScript, URL encoding and decoding can be performed using the encodeURIComponent() and decodeURIComponent() functions. 

For example, to encode a string for use in a URL, you can use:

var encoded = encodeURIComponent("Hello, World!");
console.log(encoded); // Outputs "Hello%2C%20World%21"


And to decode a string from a URL, you can use:

var decoded = decodeURIComponent("Hello%2C%20World%21");
console.log(decoded); // Outputs "Hello, World!"

Overall, URL encoding and decoding is an important aspect of web development, especially when dealing with data transmission over the internet.
