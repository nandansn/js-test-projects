// How do you define multiline strings
// You can define multiline string literals using the '\' character followed by line terminator.

// var str =
//   "This is a \
// very lengthy \
// sentence!";
// But if you have a space after the '\' character, the code will look exactly the same, but it will raise a SyntaxError.
