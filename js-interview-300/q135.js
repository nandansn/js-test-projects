// How do you add a key value pair in javascript

/*

There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object. Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.

var object = {
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
};

Using dot notation: This solution is useful when you know the name of the property
object.key3 = "value3";

Using square bracket notation: This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined.
obj["key3"] = "value3";
