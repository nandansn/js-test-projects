// Is the !-- notation represents a special operator

/*

No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,

A logical not (!)
A prefix decrement (--)
At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.
