// Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language

/*
JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, 
interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles
JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
