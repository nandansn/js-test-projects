// What are break and continue statements

/*

The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    break;
  }
  text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}
The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) {
    continue;
  }
  text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
}
