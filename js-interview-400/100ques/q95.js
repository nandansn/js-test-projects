// What is same-origin policy

/*

The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. 
An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page using Document Object Model(DOM).
