/* JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it is a lightweight data interchange format that is widely used in web development. 

JSON is a text-based format, which makes it easy for humans to read and write, and it is also easy for machines to parse and generate.

The main use of JSON is to transmit data between a server and a web application, or between different web applications. 
JSON is used as a data format because it is easy to work with, and it can be used with a wide range of programming languages, i
ncluding JavaScript, Python, Java, and many others.

JSON is often used in combination with AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to fetch data from a server without having to reload the entire web page. 
This makes web applications more responsive and user-friendly.

In addition to its use in web development, JSON is also used in many other contexts, such as data storage and configuration files. 
It has become a popular alternative to older data interchange formats such as XML, due to its simplicity and ease of use. */
