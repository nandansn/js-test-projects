// What are events
/*
In JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser or on a web page, such as a user clicking a button or scrolling down the page. 
When an event occurs, it can trigger a function or a series of functions called event handlers, which can then perform some action in response to the event.

There are many types of events in JavaScript, including:

Mouse events: such as click, mousemove, mousedown, and mouseup.
Keyboard events: such as keydown, keyup, and keypress.
Form events: such as submit, reset, focus, and blur.
Window events: such as load, unload, resize, and scroll.
HTML events: such as load, unload, change, input, and error.
To handle events in JavaScript, you can attach event listeners to HTML elements using the addEventListener() method. 
This method takes two arguments: the name of the event you want to listen for, and the function that should be executed when the event occurs. 
For example, the following code adds an event listener to a button element that logs a message to the console when it is clicked:

*/


function userAlert(params) {
    
}
