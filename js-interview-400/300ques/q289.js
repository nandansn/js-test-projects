// What is the difference between java and javascript

/**
 * Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,

Feature	                    Java	                        JavaScript
Typed	                It's a strongly typed language	It's a dynamic typed language
Paradigm	            Object oriented programming	    Prototype based programming
Scoping	                Block scoped	                Function-scoped
Concurrency	            Thread based	                event based
Memory	                Uses more memory	            Uses less memory. Hence it will be used for web page
