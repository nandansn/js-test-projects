// What are compose and pipe functions?

/**
 * The "compose" and "pipe" are two techniques commonly used in functional programming to simplify complex operations and make code more readable. They are not native in JavaScript and higher order functions. the compose() applies right to left any number of functions to the output of the previous function.
 * 
 * To make it short, composition and piping are almost the same, the only difference being the execution order; If the functions are executed from left to right, it's a pipe, on the other hand, if the functions are executed from right to left it's called compose.
