What is the purpose of breakpoints in debugging

You can set breakpoints in the javascript code once the debugger statement is executed and the debugger window pops up. 
At each breakpoint, javascript will stop executing, and let you examine the JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of 
code using the play button.
