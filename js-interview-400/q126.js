// How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object

/*

You can use the for-in loop to loop through javascript object. 
You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using hasOwnProperty method.

var object = {
  k1: "value1",
  k2: "value2",
  k3: "value3",
};

for (var key in object) {
  if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
  }
}
