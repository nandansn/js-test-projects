/**
 * What is the purpose of seal method

    The Object.seal() method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable. Let's see the below example to understand more about seal() method
 */

const object = {
  property: "Welcome JS world",
};
Object.seal(object);
object.property = "Welcome to object world";
console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // true
delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed
console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world
