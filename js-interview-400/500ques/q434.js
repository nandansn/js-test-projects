// What is debouncing?

/**
 * Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary CPU cycles, API calls and improve performance. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.

Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out using clearTimeout and reschedule API call/DB query for a new timeâ€”300 ms in the future.

function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {
    let timer;
    return (...args) => {
      clearTimeout(timer);
      timer = setTimeout(() => {
        func.apply(this, args);
      }, timeout);
    };
  }
  function fetchResults() {
    console.log("Fetching input suggestions");
  }
  const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());
