// What is an environment record?

/**
 * Usually an Environment Record is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a BlockStatement, or a Catch clause of a TryStatement.

Each time such code is evaluated, a new Environment Record is created to record the identifier bindings that are created by that code.
