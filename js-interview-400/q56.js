//What is a callback hell
/* Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

async1(function(){
    async2(function(){
        async3(function(){
            async4(function(){
                ....
            });
        });
    });
}); */
