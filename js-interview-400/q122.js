// How do you get the current url with javascript

/*

You can use window.location.href expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. 
You can also use document.URL for read-only purposes but this solution has issues in FF.

console.log("location.href", window.location.href); // Returns full URL
