## Modules

- Provide structure
- Split code into smaller files
- Share code across app
- Same as react
- Use server extension locally
- Used in projects

### Named Export

- need to mention the export keyword before the variable, declaration/definition
- import {using same name as export} from 'module name with extension .js'
- when you are using the javascript in the html, where the script uses the import then use the attribute type='module'

### default export
- 'export default' this is used to export the var/function,
- when you use default export, while importing you can use any name in the import.
