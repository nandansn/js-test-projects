## JSON
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
- JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data
- JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

### More about JSON:
   - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
   - JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
   - JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
   - JSON is used to send data between computers
   - JSON is language independent 

### Why Use JSON?

- The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

- Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.

- JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:
    - **JSON.parse()**

- JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:
    - **JSON.stringify()**


### JSON Syntax Rules

- JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

    - Data is in name/value pairs
    - Data is separated by commas
    - Curly braces hold objects
    - Square brackets hold arrays

### JSON Values

- In JSON, values must be one of the following data types:

    a string
    a number
    an object
    an array
    a boolean
    null

- In JavaScript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including:

    a function
    a date
    undefined

### JSON Files

- The file type for JSON files is ".json"
- The MIME type for JSON text is "application/json"
