### IIFE

- Immediately Invokfed Function Expression
- This is older approach, Now modules are used.
- Simple approach to avoid global scope pollution
- good way to protect the scope of your function and variables within it.

#### Exe

> create iife
>
> create iife with args
>
> create iife args and return

### Hoisting

- Function and var declarations are hoisted
- safer to access only after initialized is good practice

#### EXE

> create var, let, const and apply hoisting. remember how compiler and interpreter works
>
> create function hoisting

### Closure

- gives you an access to outer function's scope from inner function
- make private variables with closures
- create inner function and return it, function can return function
- you can use object and set the function property and return multiple functions

#### EXE

> create closure to show account balance, deposit, withdraw check limit. pass name, initial balance
>
> to outer function and create balance variable in the outer function
