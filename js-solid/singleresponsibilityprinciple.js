/**
 * A class, method or function should undertake the responsibility of one functionality. In simpler words, it should carry out only one feature/functionality.
 * 
 * In OOPs paradigm, one class should only serve one purpose. This does not mean that each class should have just one method, but the methods you define inside a class should be related to the responsibility of that class.
